## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Docker & Docker Compose**
- **VS Code** based IDE (recommended for the best developer experience)
- **<Link href="https://viteplus.dev">Vite+</Link>** — manages the Node toolchain, formatting, linting, and pre-commit hooks when working outside Docker:

<Snippet text="curl -fsSL https://vite.plus | bash" class="mt-2 mb-4 w-full" />

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Unless otherwise specified, run every command in this guide from the project root (`arcane/`).

### 1. Fork and Clone

<GitCommand class="mt-2 mb-2 w-full" />
<Snippet text="cd arcane" class="mt-2 mb-4 w-full" />

### 2. Start Development Environment

From the project root:

<Snippet text="./scripts/development/dev.sh start" class="mt-2 mb-4 w-full" />

The development environment will:

- Start both frontend and backend with hot reload
- Handle all dependencies via Docker
- Set up health checks and monitoring
- Create persistent storage for your development data

Access your development environment:

- **Frontend**: <Link href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</Link> (SvelteKit with HMR)
- **Backend**: <Link href="http://localhost:3552">http://localhost:3552</Link> (Go with Air hot reload)

## VS Code Integration

For the best development experience, we've included VS Code tasks and workspace configuration.

### Recommended Extensions

When you open the project in VS Code, you'll be prompted to install our recommended extensions. These provide:

- Docker integration and management
- Go language support with debugging
- Svelte/TypeScript support
- Integrated terminal management

### One-Click Development Commands

Use `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P` → "Tasks: Run Task" to access:

| Task              | Description                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Start**         | Start the development environment             |
| **Stop**          | Stop all services                             |
| **Restart**       | Restart all services                          |
| **Rebuild**       | Rebuild containers (after dependency changes) |
| **Clean**         | Remove all containers and volumes             |
| **Logs**          | Interactive log viewer with service selection |
| **Open Frontend** | Launch frontend in browser                    |

### Quick Build Shortcut

Press `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+B` to run the default build task (Start Environment).

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**:

   ```bash
   git switch -c feat/my-awesome-feature
   # or
   git switch -c fix/issue-123
   ```

2. **Start development** (from project root):

   ```bash
   ./scripts/development/dev.sh start
   # or use VS Code Task: "Start"
   ```

3. **Monitor logs** (choose your preferred method):

   ```bash
   # Interactive selector
   ./scripts/development/dev.sh logs

   # Specific service
   ./scripts/development/dev.sh logs frontend
   ./scripts/development/dev.sh logs backend

   # Or use VS Code Task: "Logs"
   ```

4. **Make your changes** — hot reload will automatically update:
   - **Frontend**: Instant HMR via Vite
   - **Backend**: Auto-rebuild and restart via Air

## Development Commands

All commands should be run from the project root (`arcane/`).

### Justfile Shortcuts

We provide a categorized `Justfile` for common workflows. Run `just --list` to see every category and target.

```bash
# Development
just dev docker
just dev logs

# Build
just build single frontend
just build single backend

# Tests
just test all
just test backend

# Quality checks
just lint frontend
just format frontend
just format all --check

# Dependencies
just deps install all
```

### Environment Management

```bash
# Start development environment
./scripts/development/dev.sh start

# View service status
./scripts/development/dev.sh status

# Stop all services
./scripts/development/dev.sh stop

# Restart services (for config changes)
./scripts/development/dev.sh restart

# Rebuild containers (for dependency changes)
./scripts/development/dev.sh rebuild

# Clean up everything (nuclear option)
./scripts/development/dev.sh clean
```

### Debugging & Logs

```bash
# Interactive log selection
./scripts/development/dev.sh logs

# Frontend only (Vite/SvelteKit)
./scripts/development/dev.sh logs frontend

# Backend only (Go/Air)
./scripts/development/dev.sh logs backend

# Shell access
./scripts/development/dev.sh shell frontend
./scripts/development/dev.sh shell backend
```

## Code Quality

### Automatic Formatting & Linting

Both services include development-time linting and formatting:

- **Frontend / TypeScript**: <Link href="https://viteplus.dev">Vite+</Link> (`vp fmt`, `vp check`) plus Svelte/TypeScript checks. Formatting and lint rules live in the root `vite.config.ts`.
- **Backend**: Go fmt + Go vet (built into Air hot reload)

### Pre-commit Hooks

Format checks run automatically on staged files via the Vite+ git hook dispatcher. Enable it once after cloning:

<Snippet text="vp hooks enable" class="mt-2 mb-4 w-full" />

### Manual Commands

```bash
# JS/TS formatting and lint (Vite+, run from project root)
vp fmt --check
vp check

# Or via the Justfile
just format all --check
just lint js

# Inside the Docker dev environment
docker compose -f docker/compose.dev.yaml exec frontend pnpm check
docker compose -f docker/compose.dev.yaml exec frontend pnpm format

# Backend checks
docker compose -f docker/compose.dev.yaml exec backend go fmt ./...
docker compose -f docker/compose.dev.yaml exec backend go vet ./...
```

## Commit Guidelines

We use **Conventional Commits** for clear, semantic commit messages:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication"
git commit -m "fix: resolve Docker volume mounting issue"
git commit -m "docs: update development setup guide"
git commit -m "refactor: simplify API response handling"
```

**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

## Pull Request Process

1. **Keep changes focused** — one feature or fix per PR
2. **Test your changes** — ensure both frontend and backend work
3. **Update documentation** — if you change APIs or add features
4. **Link issues** — reference issues with `Closes #123` or `Fixes #456`
5. **Be responsive** — address review feedback promptly

### PR Checklist

- [ ] Code builds successfully in the development environment
- [ ] Frontend hot reload works correctly
- [ ] Backend hot reload works correctly
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] Commit messages follow conventional format
- [ ] PR description explains the change and why it's needed

## Troubleshooting

### Development startup checklist

When `./scripts/development/dev.sh start` fails or the app does not load, validate the environment in this order before changing code:

1. Confirm Docker is installed and the daemon is reachable:

   ```bash
   docker info
   docker compose version
   ```

2. Confirm the development compose file is valid from the project root:

   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker/compose.dev.yaml -p arcane-dev config
   ```

3. Start the stack and inspect container state:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/development/dev.sh start
   ./scripts/development/dev.sh status
   ```

4. Check the expected development endpoints:

   ```bash
   curl -f http://localhost:3000
   curl -f http://localhost:3552/api/health
   ```

5. If a service is unhealthy, read the targeted logs first:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/development/dev.sh logs frontend
   ./scripts/development/dev.sh logs backend
   ```

### Common Issues

**Port conflicts:**

```bash
# Stop and clean everything (from project root)
./scripts/development/dev.sh clean

# Check for conflicting processes
lsof -i :3000  # Frontend port
lsof -i :3552  # Backend port
```

**Docker issues:**

```bash
# Reset Docker environment (from project root)
./scripts/development/dev.sh clean
docker system prune -f

# Restart development
./scripts/development/dev.sh start
```

**VS Code tasks not working:**

- Ensure you've opened the project root folder (`arcane/`) in VS Code, not a subfolder or parent directory
- Install recommended extensions when prompted
- Restart VS Code if tasks don't appear
- Verify you're in the correct working directory when running terminal commands
