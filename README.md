# Arcane Documentation Website

This documentation site is built with SvelteKit and uses Vite for local development.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install`, start a development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## PR Previews

Pull request previews are served on a custom `pr-**.arcane.ofkm.workers.dev` domain, The deployments use Wrangler and cloudflare workers.
